# Hello World!

Welcome to my tech writeups blog! This is a space where I'll be sharing my technical investigations, research findings, CTF writeups, and other interesting discoveries in the technology world.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you can expect to find detailed writeups about:

- **Security research and exploits**
- **CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge solutions**
- **Technical tutorials and guides**
- **Code analyses and reviews**
- **New tools and technologies I'm exploring**

## Why a Blog?

I believe in the power of knowledge sharing. By documenting my technical journeys, I hope to:

1. Help others who might be facing similar challenges
2. Create a record of my own learning and growth
3. Contribute to the broader tech community
4. Get feedback and insights from fellow tech enthusiasts

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** - A React framework for production
- **Markdown** - For easy content writing
- **GitHub Pages** - For hosting

## Stay Tuned!

I'm excited to start sharing content with you. The first technical writeup will be coming soon. Feel free to reach out if there are specific topics you'd like me to cover.

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Happy reading!");
}

sayHello();
```

Until next time!
